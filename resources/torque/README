Adding prologue / epilogue to your submit scripts
=================================================

1. Copy prologue and epilogue to your home directory
   # rsync -avz /apps/torque/logs/ $HOME/torque # this will get the hpc copy
   # The command below will get this copy which the parser is made for (they may be identical)
   rsync -avz /projects/afodor_research/apps/blj_support/resources/torque/ $HOME/torque


2. Put additional directive near top of submit script, with the other #PBS directives:
   ### ** CHANGE <username> to your actual username! ** ###
   #PBS -l prologue=/users/<username>/torque/prologue.sh
   #PBS -l epilogue=/users/<username>/torque/epilogue.sh
